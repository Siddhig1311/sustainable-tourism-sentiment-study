"I felt bad when I read the inscription above the door. It says - ""Erected to commemorate the landing in India of their Imperial Majesties King George V and Queen Mary on Second of December 1911"" Is it worth it? Doesn't it remind us of the dark days of slavery? Personally, I did not like coming here. ",felt bad read inscription door says erected commemorate landing india imperial majesties king george v queen mary second december worth doesnt remind us dark days slavery personally like coming,Negative,0.0
Post sunset the glamour is not presented. Lighting like Taj or other places like BMC/CST building may be adopted for attracting and promotion. The cordoned off area to the road towards Taj is not good as tourist should move freely in the crowded place,post sunset glamour presented lighting like taj places like bmccst building may adopted attracting promotion cordoned area road towards taj good tourist move freely crowded place,Positive,1.0

Saw quite a few locals harassing women especially foreigners and passing bad remarks.

"the security post that handles incoming and outgoing walking traffic is really bad.

There are three gates for people to enter and only one to go out.

Very nice place to time with friends and family. There is no entry fee and you can spend a lot of time. The history of gateway of India is written on the wall. The architecture of this structure is amazing. The place will be crowded in weekends. Evening time there will be a mini chat Street just outside the gateway of India.

"Its Pride of Aamchi Mumbai. One request to the government is to work on bringing awareness to the public on how to keep the surroundings clean.

As an Indian I hate this place. This has been built as some foreign king landed in our country. I think he has landed to rule us. Definitely not to do any favour to us.

"It was sad to see that beautiful gate surrounded by fences.
It was exteremly crowded .
And it would be nice if the area has nice set up which could serve visitors in a better way so people can have some places to sit or hang out , at least some grass so people can enjoy.
Plus there was a set up looks like a security check point which doesnt even serve the purpose, just looks ugly and unnecessary.",sad see beautiful gate surrounded fences exteremly crowded would nice area nice set could serve visitors better way people places sit hang least grass people enjoy plus set looks like security check point doesnt even serve purpose looks ugly unnecessary,Positive,1.0
